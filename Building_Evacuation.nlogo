## WHAT IS IT?

This is an evacuation simulation of the concourse building at the National University of Ireland, Galway. It uses the main theatres and classrooms in the building.

## HOW IT WORKS

Agents are randomly placed in the theatres and the seating area of the cafÃ©.When the simulation begins, all agents move to the exits.

## HOW TO USE IT

Number is the inital number of people in the model.Initially scared is the number of people at the beginning of the model who are 'afraid'.Spreadfear is the level that fear spreads from one person to another.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

The model incorporates fear and how it spreads which cause the agents to act erratically.

## THINGS TO TRY

Try altering the number of people within the model, the number of people initally afraid and the level that fear spreads.These factors can greatly alter the efficiency of the evacuation.

## CREDITS AND REFERENCES

Credit goes to Conor Horan and David Haynes of NUIG.
